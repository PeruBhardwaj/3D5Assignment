# 3D5Assignment
3D5Assignment is an android application developed as a part of course module 3D5 in Junior Sophister year at Trinity College Dublin.
This is a sample project designed to check the implementation of Google Cloud Messaging Service. 
The app asks the user to enter quotes which are saved in Google's cloud datastore. The project serves as a draft for the backend of the group project for the module. Hence the user interface is very basic.
The stored quotes can also be retrieved and are shown as toast messages.
